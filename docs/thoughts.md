tracks applications that a job seeker makes
really just one listing page and maybe a detail page, if there is enough detail  (which I don't think there is right now so maybe thats a later thing)
important items to track:
- job position
- company name
- date
- location
- job type (hybrid|onsite|remote)
- status
- notes (free text)
- links to things (application|cover letter|job description)
be able to sort applications baseed on
- company name
- date
- job type
be able to login 

technologies:
react
tailwind
- I'd like to get into how to make tailwind more repeatable so either how to re-use styles or maybe a basic design system? I'd appreciate suggestions.
firebase
- hosting
- what does it do in terms of sign in, I'm less interested in security and more just making sure people are authenticated so we can keep the data apart
- basic data needs
vite I thinnk is the way to go, other dev things:
- prettier
- husky
- linting, I'm familiar with eslint but curious about oxlint so would like to go with that if possible
- I'm sure I'm missing something so we can just add more tools later
